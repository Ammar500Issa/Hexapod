# Hexapod Robot Reinforcement Learning

## Project Description
This project involves applying reinforcement learning to a hexapod robot to learn how to walk toward a target position. The robot was built using Dynamixel AX-12A servos and controlled with a BeagleBone Blue board. A PyBullet simulation environment was created to train the robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm implemented in PyTorch.

## Key Features
- Reinforcement learning for a hexapod robot
- PyBullet simulation environment
